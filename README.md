<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Screenshot ](https://imgur.com/a/2GrokSC)

Cognitive delay, forgetting what you learned and from where you learned it?

These are some common problems students face while learning on online platforms.

We have built a web application that can help you to track every little step you take while moving forward in your learning journey.

You can create an account with just a username and password or even try to sign up with google or Facebook.

After creating an account, you can click on create a post and fill in the respective fields.

We also have a future update in which a user can use an extension to add a post to his account directly from the platform he is learning.

So that, he doesn't have to leave the learning resource in order to add it to his account.

After creating some posts, if a user wants to come back and look for what he/she learned, they can click on see posts button to see each every post that was posted by the user which is logged in with his/her credentials.
